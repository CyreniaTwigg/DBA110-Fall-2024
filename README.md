# DBA110-Fall-2024
This is my first repo.
These are examples of our labs we have been working on this semester. The repo shows us the orginial copy of what we started with. When everytime we make a change or edit to the SQL statement it will update it. After it is updated, now the new edit will be present you can also go back and look at the history of what and all was created, editied and the final end game of the repository.
